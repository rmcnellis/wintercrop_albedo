Changes in albedo and latent heat flux with conversion to winter cover crops

## general information
This repository houses data from an experiment at the USDA research station in Lubbock, Texas examining the effect of conversion to winter cover crops on albedo and latent heat flux. The dataset corresponds to the article *Winter cover crops increase winter albedo and latent heat flux in a Texas High Plains agro-ecosystem* by McNellis and Smith.

## file descriptions
### /data/seasonal_albedo_leaf.csv
This file contains stomatal conductance, leaf chlorophyll, leaf thickness, leaf area, and leaf mass. The specific column information is:
- *date*: the date of measurement, corresponds to *date* column in all other files
- *ID*: the sample ID indicating date_species_plot, corresponds to *ID* column in all other files
- *rep*: the replicate within the plot
- *conductance*: stomatal conductance measured with a Meter Porometer SC-1 (mmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>)
- *temperature*: leaf temperature measured with a Meter Porometer SC-1 (degrees Celsius)
- *leaf_angle*: the angle of the leaf from 0 - 90 measured with a PhotosynQ MultispeQ v2 (degrees)
- *rel_chlorophyll*: relative chlorophyll content measured with a PhotosynQ MultispeQ v2 using a modified version of the SPAD parameter
- *thickness*: thickness of the leaf measured with a PhotosynQ MultispeQ v2 (Âµm)
- *leaf_area*: area of leaf (mm<sup>2</sup>)
- *leaf_mass*: mass of leaf (mg)

- *cover_type*: the type of cover using the USDA symbol for species, where FAL is fallow, SECE is *Secale cereale* (rye), and TRITI2 is *xTriticosecale [Secale x Triticum]* (triticale)
- *plant_date*: the approximate planting date
- *clear_sky*: visual estimate of the percent of sky free of clouds during measurement period (%)
- *LAI*: leaf area index measured with a Li-Cor LAI-2200C (m<sup>2</sup> m<sup>-2</sup>)
