Changes in albedo and latent heat flux with conversion to winter cover crops

## general information
This repository houses data from an experiment at the USDA research station in Lubbock, Texas examining the effect of conversion to winter cover crops on albedo and latent heat flux. The dataset corresponds to the article *Winter cover crops increase winter albedo and latent heat flux in a Texas High Plains agro-ecosystem* by McNellis and Smith.
